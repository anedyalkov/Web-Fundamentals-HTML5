                We hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil. Everything we do is with and for love: love of our friends from around the
                world and the new friends we will meet in the university. We are a playful camp. We want to share great code
                with everyone who might journey to our desert jungle, and hopefully climb up our monkey trees to enjoy a
                banana.
